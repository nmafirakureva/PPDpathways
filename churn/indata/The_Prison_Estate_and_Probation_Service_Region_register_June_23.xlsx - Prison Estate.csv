Summary,,,,,,,,,,,
"There are 120 prisons and YOIs, of which 15 are operated by the contracted sector. In addition there is one STC, that is operated by the contracted sector. ",,,,,,,,,,,
"Of these 120 prisons, several are split-site prisons which are counted as two for some reporting purposes and as one for others. ",,,,,,,,,,,
"There are three prisons to which this applies: HMP Usk/Prescoed, HMP Grendon/Springhill and HMP Peterborough. ",,,,,,,,,,,
The first two of these are split-sites with one closed prison and an associated open prison. HMP Peterborough has a male and female site.,,,,,,,,,,,
These split-sites should be the first consideration when a reporting method differs from the published figure of 120 prisons.”,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
Prison Functions,,,,,,,,,,,
The below table summarises each prisoner cohort type; a prison can have more than one cohort in their prison and this is reflected in each Population Specification. ,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,

Resettlement,A resettlement prison holds Cat C offenders who have more than 28 days but equal to or less than 16 months time left to serve at the point of transfer from a reception prison.,,,,,,,,,,

,If transferring with less than 10 months time left to serve transfers must be in liaison with the POM (Prison Offender Manager) at both establishments (including the COM (Community Offender manager) if appointed).,,,,,,,,,,
Cat A & B Trainer (Dispersal),"The LT&HSE estate is made up of two different types of training prisons, these are Cat B Trainer and Cat A & B Trainer (Dispersal).  ",,,,,,,,,,
,"When allocating into the LT&HSE, consideration should be given to the level of threat & risk each prisoner poses to the public. ",,,,,,,,,,
,"Those who are deemed the most risk to the public based on offence profile, age and significant time left to serve should be directed to the Cat A & B Trainer (Dispersal) prisons.",,,,,,,,,,
,No minimum or maximum sentence length applies.,,,,,,,,,,
,Transfers into the Cat B training estate are co-ordinated with Population Management Unit (PMU) allocating bed space. ,,,,,,,,,,
,"Consultation will then take place between the sending prison, the LT&HSE central team (email: HSPG.PopulationManagement@justice.gov.uk)  and receiving Cat B to ensure the transfer is safe and appropriate.",,,,,,,,,,
Cat B Trainer,"As a national resource, and part of the LT&HSE, Cat B training prisons population accommodate offenders who have been categorised B and who have more than 28 days time left to serve at the point of transfer.",,,,,,,,,,

Probation Service Regions,,,,,,,,,,,
Probation Service Region - Geographical Location of the Prison,,,,,,,,,,,
"All prisons have a geographical location which dictates which Probation Service Region they're in.  This column states which Probation Service Region the prison is located in,  but does not necessarily dictate where or if the prisons will resettle into.  ",,,,,,,,,,,
"For Example, an open prison will sit in the geographical location of a Probation Service Region, however, they are still a National Resource and can resettle men to any area. ",,,,,,,,,,,
Probation Service Regions - Expected Resettlement Region and/or National Resource,,,,,,,,,,,
This column indicates where the prisons are expected to resettle.  Resettlement services are no longer limited to specific areas due to the changes made by Probation Reform.   ,,,,,,,,,,,
"Where prisons are a National Resource or have an expected resettlement area, this has been indicated in this column (some prisons have more than one expected resettlement area and/or due to multiple cohorts within the same prison, may also include National Resource). ",,,,,,,,,,,
