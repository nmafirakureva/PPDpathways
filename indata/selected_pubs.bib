abstract = {Background. There are limited published data on the characteristics of blood transfusion recipients in sub-Saharan Africa. This study describes the demographic characteristics of blood transfusion recipients and patterns of blood and blood component use in Zimbabwe. Materials and methods. Data on the characteristics of the blood transfusion recipients (age, sex, blood group), blood components received (type, quantity), discharge diagnoses and outcomes following transfusion (discharge status, duration of stay in hospital), were retrospectively collected from four major hospitals for the period from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2012. Diagnoses were grouped into broad categories according to the disease headings of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). Surgical procedures were grouped into broad categories according to organ system using ICD-9. Results. Most of the 1,793 transfusion recipients studied were female (63.2\%) and in the reproductive age group, i.e. 15-49 years (65.3\%). The median age of the recipients was 33 years (range, 0-93). The majority of these recipients (n=1,642; 91.6\%) received a red blood cell transfusion. The majority of the patients were diagnosed with conditions related to pregnancy and childbirth (22.3\%), and diseases of blood and blood-forming organs (17.7\%). The median time spent in hospital was 8 days (range, 0-214) and in-hospital mortality was 15.4\%. Discussion. Our sample of blood transfusion recipients were fairly young and most of them received red blood cell transfusions. The majority of patients in the reproductive age group received blood transfusions for pregnancy and childbirth-related diagnoses.},

abstract = {Background. Haemovigilance hinges on a systematically structured reporting system, which unfortunately does not always exist in resource-limited settings. We determined the incidence and pattern of transfusion-related adverse events reported to the National Blood Service Zimbabwe. Materials and methods. A retrospective review of the transfusion-event records of the National Blood Service Zimbabwe was conducted covering the period from 1 January 1999 to 31 December 2011. All transfusion-related event reports received during the period were analysed. Results. A total of 308 transfusion adverse events (0.046\%) were reported for 670,625 blood components distributed. The majority (61.6\%) of the patients who experienced an adverse event were female. The median age was 36 years (range, 1-89 years). The majority (68.8\%) of the adverse events were acute transfusion reactions consisting of febrile non-haemolytic transfusion reactions (58.5\%), minor allergies (31.6\%), haemolytic reactions (5.2\%), severe allergic reactions (2.4\%), anaphylaxis (1.4\%) and hypotension (0.9\%). Two-thirds (66.6\%) of the adverse events occurred following administration of whole blood, although only 10.6\% of the blood was distributed as whole blood. Packed cells, which accounted for 75\% of blood components distributed, were associated with 20.1\% of the events. Discussion. The incidence of suspected transfusion adverse events was generally lower than the incidences reported globally in countries with well-established haemovigilance systems. The administration of whole blood was disproportionately associated with transfusion adverse events. The pattern of the transfusion adverse events reported here highlights the probable differences in practice between different settings. Under-reporting of transfusion events is rife in passive reporting systems. © SIMTI Servizi Srl.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to develop a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic ({PKPD}) model that quantifies the efficacy of haloperidol, accounting for the placebo effect, the variability in exposure-response, and the dropouts. Subsequently, the developed model was utilized to characterize an effective dosing strategy for using haloperidol as a comparator drug in future antipsychotic drug trials. The time course of plasma haloperidol concentrations from 122 subjects and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ({PANSS}) scores from 473 subjects were used in this analysis. A nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach was utilized to describe the time course of {PK} and {PANSS} scores. Bootstrapping and simulation-based methods were used for the model evaluation. A 2-compartment model adequately described the haloperidol {PK} profiles. The Weibull and Emax models were able to describe the time course of the placebo and the drug effects, respectively. An exponential model was used to account for dropouts. Joint modeling of the {PKPD} model with dropout model indicated that the probability of patients dropping out is associated with the observed high {PANSS} score. The model evaluation results confirmed that the precision and accuracy of parameter estimates are acceptable. Based on the {PKPD} analysis, the recommended oral dose of haloperidol to achieve a 30\% reduction in {PANSS} score from baseline is 5.6 mg/d, and the corresponding steady-state effective plasma haloperidol exposure is 2.7 ng/{mL}. In conclusion, the developed model describes the time course of {PANSS} scores adequately, and a recommendation of haloperidol dose was derived for future antipsychotic drug trials.},

abstract = {Good operations and supply chain management practices are essential for the existence of both private and public organisations offering goods or rendering services. These practices are subject to volatile changes in markets due to global developments, and hence it is important to understand the drivers of change to be able to respond adequately. Emerging issues in operations and supply chain management covers a number of these drivers within the realm of operations and the supply chains serving businesses, so that the reader is equipped to respond with robustness in the changing environment. The book covers the topics from a practical perspective and shares many case studies and examples to take the reader on a logical path towards understanding the issues in operations and supply chain management, and the importance of the drivers of change while sharing practical advice and solutions for the global industry.},
